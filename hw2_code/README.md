# 11775 Homework 2
In this homework, I used SURF and CNN features for multimedia event detection.

In detail, ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet dataset and VGG16 trained on Places365 are used for CNN feature extraction.

### Feature Extraction
```
bash run.feature.sh -p true -f true -m true -k true -y config.yaml
```

### Training and Testing
```
./run.med.sh
```
